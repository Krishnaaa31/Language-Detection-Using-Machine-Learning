# Language Detection Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting the language of a given text using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains text samples in multiple languages, and the goal is to accurately classify the language of each text. The project involves preprocessing text data, converting it into a numerical form, and applying various classification algorithms to achieve high accuracy in language detection.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of text samples in the following languages:

- English
- French
- Spanish
- Portuguese
- Italian
- Russian
- Swedish
- Malayalam
- Dutch
- Arabic
- Turkish
- German
- Tamil
- Danish
- Kannada
- Greek
- Hindi

The dataset includes 10,337 text entries across these languages.
